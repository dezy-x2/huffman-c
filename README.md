# huffman-c

#### Hi there!

I'm trying to make the Huffman Lossless Compression Algorithm in C. This is my first self guided project in C so it ain't pretty at the moment but I promise I'm working on it.

### LATEST UPDATE!

As of Apr 1, 2022 the algorithm can go over a string and place it in a linkedList. If it encounters a letter n times it will mark its frequency as n!! this is a major part of the Huffman algo so now I need to place it all in a tree based on frequency and then thats pretty much it!
**Pretty lit**
