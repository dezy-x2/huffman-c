# huffman-c

#### Hi there!

I'm trying to make the Huffman Lossless Compression Algorithm in C. This is my first self guided project in C so it ain't pretty at the moment but I promise I'm working on it.

### LATEST UPDATE!

New stuff as of Apr 5, 2022. The bubble sort algorithm now works so now the linked list can be sorted by the char frequency. This will allow us to much more easily add the nodes to a tree. This is going very well right now I'm happy with what we have.
**Pretty lit**
